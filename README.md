# TV-Tennis-Project STEFAN COOPER


This was a 1st Year Uni group project for the Platforms for computing project. In this module we learned about assembly language and the core concepts of computing logic amongst various other important lessons.

In this repository you can follow the commits between myself and Leon. We collaborated on two seperate technologies to create a version of the retro game Pong (TV-Tennis) using a virtual 8-bit processor. Through collaboration I wrote the software side of the system using a custom assembly language from the university known as CDM8. With Leon implementing my software into the hardware using a program called Logisim. I found this task very engaging and interesting to work on.

## Technologies used in this project:

### Software-side:

CDM8 Assembly Language

### Hardware-side:

Logisim for creating the board and implementing software

## Set up

### File Downloads:

Request access (DM/email me) to the CDM8 Python Project that has been provided to us by the University of Hertfordshire.

Download Logisim http://www.cburch.com/logisim/

### Instructions:

- Run `cocoide.pyw` with Python3.
- Using the cocoIDE interface, open `Pong Source 2 Software.asm`
- Using the cocoIDE interface, save an image of the asm file. Naming it something memorable.
- Run the Logisim application
- Open `PongV2.circ` in Logisim
- (If it requires a specific library, locate the libary (I would have provided this to you also))
- Load the image you saved earlier (step 3) in the memory location with the word `code` underneath it
- Enable `Simulation` & `Ticks` in Logisim. Now you should be good to go to get started!
